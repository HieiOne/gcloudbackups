This software is provided "as is" with absolute no warranty. Use this under your own responsibility.

To make installation easier, download the folder "Installation" and execute the .cmd for a default installation, you may install it any other place if you want 
but make sure to change the paths inside GcloudConf.ps1

Important as of version 9.1.2b: Log folder name changed to "Logs" instead of GcloudLogs, if you still want to use the old naming system you're free to change it in the Conf file.

Update! Version 9.4b now you can use a Cygwin installation to run the gsutil commands increasing perfomance and upload speed (steps to do this in the config file)
